This Python module is an attempt to implement a class for storing vectors of
bits.  Yes, I know <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/BitVector> and
<https://pypi.python.org/pypi/bitarray/> already exist; this is primarily a
learning exercise for me, and if my version ends up with more features, all the
better.
